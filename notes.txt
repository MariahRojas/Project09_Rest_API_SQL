Introducing Basic Authentication
A common approach to identifying users is a process called "key based authentication". Key based authentication requires two pieces of information:
a unique key or identifier—typically the user's username or email address—and a secret—typically the user's password.

    When using Basic Authentication, the client sets an "Authorization" header on each request that's sent to a protected route on the server.

        Here's an example Authorization header and value:

            Authorization: Basic am9lQHNtaXRoLmNvbTpqb2VwYXNzd29yZA==

            In this example, the header field name is "Authorization", followed by a colon (i.e. ":"),
            and to the right of the colon is the header value: "Basic am9lQHNtaXRoLmNvbTpqb2VwYXNzd29yZA==".
